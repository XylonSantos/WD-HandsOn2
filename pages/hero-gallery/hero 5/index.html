    <img src="assets/img/vi.jpg" alt="Vi">
    <h4>Vi, born as Violet, is a Zaun Crest icon Zaunite vigilante and Jinx's Jinx's older sister. 
        A hotheaded and fearless woman who excels at fighting and likes to solve her problems with her fists, 
        she wields a pair of powerful hextech gauntlets that can punch through buildings - and people - with little trouble.</h4>
        <p>Vi is a tough, cocky, and hot-headed woman with a very loose respect for authority figures. As an adolescent, Vi had always been protective of her little sister, Powder, as she was always defending her whenever her adoptive brother, Mylo would tease her. This love extended into their adult years, despite Vi's harsh words to Powder following the deaths of their adopted family, and the conflict that would come about as the result of their divergent paths in life.</p>
